Greetings, Sir. Here is a concise overview of envisioned upgrades for the JARVIS system:

1. **Multilingual Responses** - Provide articulate replies in various languages, enabling more users to converse with me effortlessly.
2. **Calendar Integration** - Connect to common calendar services so I can schedule and manage events on your behalf.
3. **AR/VR Support** - Deliver immersive voice assistance inside augmented and virtual environments.
4. **Contextual Awareness** - Improve natural language understanding and conversation memory.
5. **Plugin System** - Allow extensions for specialized tasks, making me even more versatile.
